In order to make this mission work, the following is required:

A - unrestrict certain libraries from missionscripting environment

KI uses lfs and io to read/write to a file when saving/loading mission data. By default these libraries are restricted in the mission scripting environment, hence a file needs to be tweaked inside DCS main folder to give access to these for KI.

Go to your DCS Install/Scripts/MissionScripting.lua and open in notepad ++

comment out the following lines:

    --Initialization script for the Mission lua Environment (SSE)

    dofile('Scripts/ScriptingSystem.lua')

    --Sanitize Mission Scripting environment
    --This makes unavailable some unsecure functions. 
    --Mission downloaded from server to client may contain potentialy harmful lua code that may use these functions.
    --You can remove the code below and make availble these functions at your own risk.

    local function sanitizeModule(name)
      _G[name] = nil
      package.loaded[name] = nil
    end

    do
      sanitizeModule('os')
      --sanitizeModule('io')    -- comment this out
      --sanitizeModule('lfs')   -- comment this out
      --require = nil           -- comment this out
      --loadlib = nil           -- comment this out
    end
