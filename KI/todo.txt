KI Loader

-- currently saving active missions also saves any object arguments they had, but in a bad format where the objects cannot be respawned and reattached to the side mission. Will need to write code to export ActiveMissions with proper data so that any resources can be respawned. Similarly these resources also need to be ignored in the GroundUnits table (otherwise duplicate spawning of the same object will occur).

-- Implement ways to rehook GC to respawned inactive objects
-- Implement player scoring when unhooking cargo, hooking cargo, resupplying a depot, capture zone, etc
-- Implement a way for a spawn point zone and wp zone to be randomly selected with DSMT (ie. random convoy spawn)
-- Implement logistics convoys? suppliers? depot resupply?
-- Implement methods for retrieving Lat Long, MGRS coordinates from Object Points
-- Implement Slot Blocking on a FARP when it's lost it's ground crew, or been captured by enemy
-- Implement file write backup strategy, and checks for reloading previous save if current file is corrupted/damaged
-- Implement Scheduled Manager, that will restart any scheduled functions that have crashed or stopped responding
-- Implement Player Slots sending data via sockets to server (such as whats in KO)
-- Implement Map website
-- Implement Simple Radio Auto Kick
-- Implement CSAR script





Server Side logic

-- Slot block when a FARP or Airbase is not SIDE RED  - use SimpleSlotBlock in Mission Script code
-- Track Banned Players
	-- Save them to a database with their status
	-- Upon Start Up of mission, Server should get the player status from File or Database?
	-- When should the server refresh it's player data ?
	-- When should the server send it's player data to database?
-- Track how many lives a player has
	-- Where do we get this information from?
	-- How often should we refresh our data?
	-- How often should we send data to database?
